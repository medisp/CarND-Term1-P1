    "# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** \n",
    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

Originally, I designed the code to handle directories of images and realized that the processing upon a single image was all that was necessary to work on the videos. I tried using multiple passes of hough line generation to see if redrawing the extrapolated lines would be a better mechanism.\n",

    "Which didn't perform to the same degree as what I ultimately used in scipy libraries.\n",
    "I will need to adjust the filtering of slopes that were ultimately used in regression to make a single lane line for both left and right lines. This is why the challenge video looks so disastrous. I will be tweaking this filtering with other adjustments to the linreg algorithm to make the challenge result to be fitting properly.\n",
